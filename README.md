<h3>This is my dotfile repo for all to use, and for my own convenience.</h3>

In my search for a GTK theme, I stumbled upon an old one called Kripton, which I found to be quite beautiful, but it didn't quite fit in with the rest of my setup. So I took it upon myself and created a Kripton color palette based on the GTK theme, and then made Kripton themes for the software I use. This is going to be a work in progress, as I'm considering taking this seriously and kickstart a project to cover as many software and websites as possible. I highly doubt it could ever be on the same level as Catppuccin's or Nord's, but it's an enticing idea all the same.

# Notes
The depnedencies listed are for my own reference and to insure the functions of my setup work as intended.

I thought I'd also drop in my own Firefox setup, which I'm fairly certain you haven't seen anything like before. I primarily say this because I specifically built it to sing on my Hyprland setup.

You may as well go the extra mile and complete the look, and you only need one addon:

- [Adaptive Tab Bar Color](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adaptive-tab-bar-colour/)
